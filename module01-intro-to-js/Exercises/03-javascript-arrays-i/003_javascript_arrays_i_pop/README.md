Pop
===

The `.pop()` method is a basic yet essential array method in JavaScript that removes the last element from an array.

It modifies the original array by removing the last item and returns the removed element.

If the array is empty, it returns `undefined`. This method is commonly used when you need to process and remove items from the end of an array sequentially.

### Practical Use:

*   **Stack operations**: Perfect for stack-like behavior (Last-In, First-Out), where it represents the `pop` operation of the stack.
*   **Managing collections**: Useful for managing collections where only the most recently added element needs to be removed and used.
*   **Dynamic size adjustment**: Helps in scenarios where the array size needs to be decreased dynamically based on certain conditions or operations.
