Unshift
=======

The `.unshift()` method is used to add one or more elements to the beginning of an array, which shifts existing elements to higher indices.

It modifies the original array by inserting the specified elements at the start and returns the new length of the array.

This method can handle multiple elements at once, providing a flexible way to prepend items to an array.

### Practical Use:

*   **Dynamic collection manipulation**: Allows for dynamic growth of collections where the order of addition or the elements themselves carry significance.
*   **Complex data processing**: Useful in scenarios involving complex data structures where elements must be processed or added in specific orders.
